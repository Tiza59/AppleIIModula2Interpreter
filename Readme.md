The disassembly of the Modula2 Interpreter for DOS3.3 was done with The Flaming Bird Disassembler (TFBD) downloadable from BrutalDeluxe's website (http://www.brutaldeluxe.fr).

Acknowledgements: The disassembly of the interpreter would not be possible without help from Willie Kusche.

Tools required:
1) ProDOS version of EdAsm
2) HexEditor e.g HxD (Windows) Hex Fiend(macOS)
